# financelib

## Motivation
The library was created to be a reasonably complete package for all major financial formulas used in Finance. The codes are all in *pure* Rust. It encompasses most of the common area of *Finance* - *Accounts, Balance Sheets, Equity, Bonds, Derivatives, Free Cash Flows, Valuations etc*

Unless otherwise mentioned, the *US 30/360* day-convention is used for all formulas. This is the default option in MS Excel. 

The project is currently in *work-in-progress (WIP) stage* and it is *strongly advised **not*** to use it.

## Features
The library exports a base module **financelib** and all domains in Finance are exported as submodule of the same. 

## Code examples


## Installation
